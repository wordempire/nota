# Nota ~~New and Improved~~
## Notable changes
* main export in `package.json` is now nota, and not server
* Nota constructor accepts an optional configuration argument, so both argv and function arguments will work now

## Problems
* Right now, the system spins up an entire server for every pdf request (instead, servers should manage phanomjs instances in a robust and dynamic manner)
* Port configuration is static => singleton instance, not scalable

## Workarounds/hacks
1. First install nota as a local npm package (e.g. `npm install ../nota`)
2. Then, create a `conf` folder by issueing `ln -s node_modules/nota conf`
3. Link the templates folder: `ln -s node_modules/nota/templates templates`
4. Do not forget about deps for the templates (`bower install` for the exiting ones)

## Original docs
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5121848/Nota_demo.png"> Nota
eats your template (HTML5+CSS3+JS) + your data (JSON) and excretes pretty
(PDF) documents. Perfect for things like automating invoice or ticket
generation, but of course not limited to. Nota can be used for any kind of
document typesetting, layout and markup jobs, especially those that require
automation and custom processing/presentation of data.

Develop and debug while feeling right at home in your favorite browser, with a
1:1 preview of what Nota turns into a .PDF for you. If you like to write your
templates in CoffeeScript and SASS, Grunt will automatically compile your
assets as you dev. Get all your favorite libraries and frontend goodies like
Bootstrap, Backbone.js or AngularJS wired up in seconds with Bower. Nota makes
designing and programming your documents a breeze.

Spare yourself the headache and mind numbing routine of creating series of
documents in Microsoft Word, Adobe CS, LaTeX or whatever ancient means of
getting your PDF fix. Use the Nota API to process your bulk jobs and banish
intellectual slave labour.

## Setup
Due to kinks (see [Known problems](https://github.com/FelixAkk/nota#known-problems)) in the depencencies that are still being
worked out, Nota is a bit picky on it's environment and dependencies. We
recommend running Nota in a virtual environment, and this is easy with
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com). This also prevents machine pollution and
isolates conflict. So for your convenience, we have included a Vagrant machine
specification, but you can also install is as usual directly on your machine.

Fancy virtual setup using Vagrant:

1. Install Vagrant
1. Move the the place where you cloned the repository
1. Run `vagrant up`, this takes a few minutes.
1. Once done, as separate Ubuntu 14.04 LTS box is installed.
1. You can either SSH into the machine with `vagrant ssh` or simply run your
   first generation with `vagrant ssh -c "cd /vagrant && node dist/nota.js
   --template=/vagrant/examples/hello_world
   --data=/vagrant/examples/hello_world/data.json"`
1. The `output.pdf` file appears in the root of the repository.

Old skool setup on the bare metal:

1. Open the location you cloned the repository in the terminal.
1. Install the following packages `git npm nodejs phantomjs`
1. Ensure the `node` executable is in your path `[ -f /usr/bin/node ] || ln -s
   /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`
1. Install the sass gem `gem install sass`
1. Run npm `npm install`
1. Install additional npm packages `npm install -g sass bower grunt grunt-cli`
1. Run bower `bower install`
1. Create your first PDF with the following command `node dist/nota.js
   --template=examples/hello_world --data=examples/hello_world/data.json`

## Architecture

Technically this primarily consists out of a pipeline of
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (headless WebKit browser for rendering HTML
and capturing PDF) with the [phantomjs- node](https://github.com/sgentle
/phantomjs-node) bindings for interfacing using
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). So all the credits really go out to them. This
package is mostly some frameworking and task automation around the
beforementioned, to make the job of crafting and rendering templates easier.

## Usage

To get a feel of Nota, run  the following line:
````
node dist/nota.js --template=example-aerix --data=json/example.json
````

When finished Nota has rendered a simple PDF page, consisting of some custom
rendering of data. Change the company logo image and try modifing the example
data to see how easy it is to customise your own invoice.

Try some of the simpler static "Hello World" templates and customize them with
any inline CSS, linked stylesheets or JavaScript. Any of the assets like
images you use should be available in the template directory. You can also write in SASS and CoffeeScript and have it automagically compiled by running `grunt` in de Nota root.

Add the switch `--template=<dir>` to select a template by directory. Add the
switch `--data=<path>` with a path from the Nota root directory to the JSON
that should be rendered. Add the switch `--port=<port>` with a port (larger
than 1024) to select which port to use. This is useful for situations in which
you are rendering lots of PDFs simultaneously.

By default Nota will output the PDF in the root rolder of itself, in a file
called `output.pdf`. When this is not want you want, simply add
`--output=x.pdf` (which will save the file in the Nota root folder) or
`--output=/tmp/x.pdf` (which saves the file on the absolute path).


## Known problems

Nota is young, experimental, and built on a still developing tech stack. There
are still quite some shortcomings and bugs (none that aren't likely to be
fixed in the near future). That said, we've been able to use Nota in
production environments already. If you take care to test your setup, verify
the results and can live with some flaws, you should be fine. Consider the
current version a showcase of the potential of this tech stack and the future
of Nota. Here's some things to take into account:

#### No clickable hyperlinks
Even though WebKit supports this, due to a
[bug](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/10196) in QtWebKit which
PhantomJS builts on the current output PDFs have no clickable links. This has
quite some pressing attention and already a proposed fix, so it's likely to be
fixed soon, but no fix committed to Qt yet. For now we recommend making links
that have URL as the text so users can copy-paste that, or avoid them.

#### Selectable text
It seems PhantomJS only generates PDFs with selectable text on Linux due to a
[bug](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/10373). More
information/research on specifics and other operating systems is needed. For
now we recommend using the Vagrant spec to run Nota virtualized on Linux.

#### Fonts
Due to [a bug](http://arunoda.me/blog/phantomjs-webfonts-build.html) in
PhantomJS, the loading of webfonts (even if they're locally hosted) seems
broken. For now you'll have to install the fonts on the system manually, and
then they'll load as expected. More research on in development versions of
PhantomJS is needed.


## Meta

#### Developers
Nota was originally comissioned by [Aerix](https://www.aerix.nl) to automate
the task of invoice generations after alternatives like LaTex or MS Office
proved insufficient in the flexibility and easy of producing neatly designed
documents through a programmable interfaces.

Shortly after [inventid](https://www.inventid.nl) joined in on development
after it adopted Nota for automating the production of event tickets.

Both Aerix and inventid are two young Dutch internetbureaus who are
passionate about making shiny apps and contributing to open source innovation.

#### How to suggest improvements?
We are still actively developing Nota for our internal use, but we would
already love to hear your feedback. In case you have some great ideas, you may
just [open an issue](https://github.com/inventid/nota/issues/new). Be sure to
check beforehand whether the same issue does not already exist.

#### How can I contribute?
We feel contributions from the community are extremely worthwhile. If you use
Nota in production and make some modification, please share it back to the
community. You can simply [fork the
repository](https://github.com/inventid/nota/fork), commit your changes to
your code and create a pull request back to this repository.

#### Collaborators
We would like to thank the developers which contributed to Nota, both big and
small.
